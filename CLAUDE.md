## Scotch Library Source

**IMPORTANT**: This environment cannot connect to the Inria GitLab server.

When working with the scotch library dependency:

- **DO NOT** attempt to clone the submodule from `https://gitlab.inria.fr/scotch/scotch.git`
- **INSTEAD**: Clone from the GitHub mirror at `https://github.com/live-clones/scotch`

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone scotch from GitHub (not the GitLab submodule)
git clone https://github.com/live-clones/scotch scotch/
```

The GitHub repository is a live mirror of the official Inria GitLab repository and is accessible from this environment.
