# PyScotch Roadmap

**Version:** 7.0.0 (released 2026-07-13; versions mirror the supported Scotch series)
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-28 (status sections; the phase/version-target sections below predate the 7.0.0 release and are kept as history)

This document provides an honest assessment of what's implemented, what's in progress, and what's planned for PyScotch.

🎉 **Phase 1 Complete!** All Scotch distributed graph operations are now implemented and tested!

---

## ✅ Fully Implemented & Tested

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **Multi-variant architecture** - Load 4 Scotch variants simultaneously (32/64-bit × sequential/parallel)
- ✅ **FILE* compatibility layer** - `libpyscotch_compat.so` for cross-platform FILE* handling
- ✅ **RAII resource management** - Automatic cleanup with context managers
- ✅ **Type hints** - Full typing support for better IDE experience

### Sequential Graph Operations (Graph class)
- ✅ `Graph.load()` - Load from Scotch .grf format
- ✅ `Graph.save()` - Save to Scotch .grf format
- ✅ `Graph.build()` - Build from arrays
- ✅ `Graph.from_edges()` - Create from edge list
- ✅ `Graph.check()` - Validate graph structure
- ✅ `Graph.size()` - Get vertex/edge counts
- ✅ `Graph.partition()` - Graph partitioning
- ✅ `Graph.order()` - Graph ordering for sparse matrices
- ✅ `Graph.save_mapping()` - Save partition to file

### Distributed Graph Operations (Dgraph class)
- ✅ `Dgraph.__init__()` - Initialize distributed graph
- ✅ `Dgraph.load()` - Load distributed graph
- ✅ `Dgraph.build()` - Build from distributed arrays
- ✅ `Dgraph.check()` - Validate distributed graph (tested with MPI)
- ✅ `Dgraph.data()` - Get graph data with selective field retrieval ⭐
- ✅ `Dgraph.coarsen()` - Graph coarsening (all 3 modes: plain, fold, folddup) ⭐
- ✅ `Dgraph.coarsen_vert_loc_max()` - Get multinode array size
- ✅ `Dgraph.ghst()` - Compute ghost edge array ⭐ NEW!
- ✅ `Dgraph.grow()` - Grow subgraphs from seeds ⭐ NEW!
- ✅ `Dgraph.band()` - Extract band graph ⭐ NEW!
- ✅ `Dgraph.redist()` - Redistribute graph across processes ⭐ NEW!
- ✅ `Dgraph.induce_part()` - Extract induced subgraph ⭐ NEW!

### Supporting Classes
- ✅ **Strategy** - Partitioning/ordering strategies
  - `Strategy.reset()` (back to the default; family-agnostic; the string
    setters accept `None` as a synonym — strings, `""` included, are passed
    to Scotch verbatim)
  - `Strategy.set_mapping()` / `set_ordering()` / `set_overlap_partitioning()`
    and the dgraph variants (strategy strings)
  - `Strategy.request_mapping()` / `request_ordering()` + `StrategyFlags`
    (flag-based builds, recommended)
  - `Strategy.built_for_mapping()` / `built_for_ordering()` /
    `built_for_overlap()` (materialized handles for tight loops)
  - `Strategy.set_recursive_bisection()`
  - (`set_multilevel()` / `set_nested_dissection()` were removed: Scotch's
    default IS multilevel / nested-dissection based, so they could only ever
    alias the default build — see CHANGELOG)
- ✅ **Strategies** - Pre-defined strategy factories
  - `Strategies.partition_quality()`
  - `Strategies.partition_fast()`
  - `Strategies.order_quality()`
  - `Strategies.order_fast()`
- ✅ **Architecture** - Target architectures
  - `Architecture.complete()` - Complete graph
  - `Architecture.complete_graph()` - Static method
- ✅ **Mapping** - Partition assignments
  - Save/load, analyze balance, access partitions
- ✅ **Ordering** - Vertex orderings
  - Apply/inverse, save/load
- ✅ **Mesh** - Basic mesh operations
  - `Mesh.load()`, `Mesh.save()`
  - `Mesh.check()`, `Mesh.to_graph()`
  - `Mesh.partition()` ⚠️ (minimal testing)

### Testing
- ✅ **177 unit tests** for sequential operations
- ✅ **11 MPI tests** for distributed operations ⭐ NEW!
  - `test_dgraph_init` - Initialization
  - `test_dgraph_build` - Building graphs
  - `test_dgraph_check` - Validation (2 tests)
  - `test_dgraph_coarsen` - Coarsening (3 tests)
  - `test_dgraph_grow` - Region growing ⭐ NEW!
  - `test_dgraph_band` - Band graph extraction ⭐ NEW!
  - `test_dgraph_redist` - Graph redistribution ⭐ NEW!
  - `test_dgraph_induce_part` - Induced subgraph ⭐ NEW!
- ✅ **Compatibility tests** - Verify library builds (4 tests)

**Total: 192 passing tests** ✨

## 🚧 Partially Implemented

### Mesh Operations
- ✅ Basic load/save/partition
- ❌ Advanced mesh operations
- ❌ Limited test coverage

---

## ❌ Not Implemented (High Priority)

### Missing Testing
- ❌ **Integration tests** - No end-to-end workflow tests
- ❌ **Performance benchmarks** - No performance validation
- ❌ **Stress tests** - No large-scale testing

### Missing Infrastructure
- ✅ **Command-Line Interface** - Implemented (`pyscotch` command: partition/order/check/info/doctor/scotch)
- ✅ **Examples directory** - `examples/` with 5 runnable scripts + README
- ✅ **Documentation examples** - docs site embeds executed examples (`docs/site/examples/`)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### FILE* Limitations
Despite `libpyscotch_compat.so`, **9 tests still blocked** by FILE* issues:
- Complex FILE* operations (dump, mapping save/load to FILE*)
- Need investigation to determine workarounds

### Documentation Issues
- ✅ **FIXED**: CLI implemented and documented in API.md
- ✅ **FIXED**: examples/ directory exists with working code
- ⚠️ **REMAINING**: Some documented workflows need validation

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Core Distributed Operations ✅ COMPLETE!
**Goal:** Achieve feature parity for documented distributed operations

- [x] Implement `Dgraph.band()` with test ✅
- [x] Implement `Dgraph.grow()` with test ✅
- [x] Implement `Dgraph.induce_part()` with test ✅
- [x] Implement `Dgraph.redist()` with test ✅
- [x] Implement `Dgraph.ghst()` (prerequisite for grow) ✅

**Impact:** 100% of Scotch distributed graph operations now implemented! 🎉

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (Priority 2)
**Goal:** Validate real-world workflows

- [ ] Integration test: Sequential partitioning workflow
  - Load graph → partition → save mapping → validate
- [ ] Integration test: Distributed coarsening workflow
  - Load distributed graph → coarsen → validate → compare with Scotch
- [ ] Integration test: Mesh partitioning workflow
  - Load mesh → partition → convert to graph → validate

### Phase 3: Performance Validation (Priority 3)
**Goal:** Ensure performance is acceptable

- [ ] Benchmark: Sequential partitioning vs native Scotch
- [ ] Benchmark: Distributed operations vs native PT-Scotch
- [ ] Benchmark: Memory overhead of Python wrapper
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

### Phase 4: User Experience (Priority 4)
**Goal:** Make library easy to use

- [x] Create `examples/` directory (5 scripts + README, incl. `hello_pyscotch.py`)
- [x] Implement CLI (documented in API.md)
- [ ] Add Jupyter notebook tutorials

### Phase 5: Production Hardening (Priority 5)
**Goal:** Make production-ready

- [ ] Investigate and resolve 9 FILE* blocked tests
- [ ] Add stress tests (large graphs, many processes)
- [ ] Add error recovery testing
- [ ] Memory leak testing
- [ ] Consider co-maintainers
